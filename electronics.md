# Electronics

## The sensorial experience

- you can listen to your power supply to understand what is going on:
  - no sound at all : no load
  - constant, steady gentle buzzing sound : should be ok
  - making screechy (painful) sounds or clicking/chugging : could be short circuits (or another problem)
- you may touch components with your fingers (be careful, only on low voltage, and just fast swipe/brush) and touch table and basic ground components like ethernet component

## The multimeter

If measuring voltage, then beware of not creating short circuits while not in the voltage mode with your cables, same for currents
On technical documentation with schematics, you will find the numbers like test point numbers (TPxx)
